# Investigate the TMDb Dataset
This project was done in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
## Overview
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue,cast,release year.

The project involved data assessment and cleaning, performing EDA and drawing conclusions from the data.

## Installations
- Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
From my analysis i discovered that:

- There has been a noticeable increase in both the number of movies released and the revenue generated from these movies over the years. 
- The average run time of movies is 109 minutes. Movies tend to run a bit longer rather than shorter with the most movies having a duration between 80 and 120 minutes. The length of movies showed no obvious correlation to the budget which tells us that shorter movies are not necessarily cheaper to make and vice versa.
- The 3 genres that movies most commonly fit into are drama, comedy, thriller. However, the genre of movies that was the most popular was action, despite being only the fourth most commonly made.
- The top five actors that had appeared in the most movies were Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Cage and Matt Damon.
